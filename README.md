# Tech Basics 2 Exam Project
## Where are we?

This repository contains my Tech Basics 2 Exam MVP. I have built an app which allows friends to connect via sharing their location and staying safe by keeping track of each other. Users are able to immediately contact Emergency if they are in danger.

- Upon launching _app.py_ you are greeted with an emergency page that allows the user to press a button and call for help, or proceed to the homepage of the app via a second button.
- The homepage shows a map and has five buttons that guide the user onto different pages.
- The first three buttons simulate the location of friends. Each button directs the user to a profile page of the friend. From there the user can carry out a few different tasks by clicking on buttons.
  
  - The user can dial the number of the friend.
  - The user can view a map and see the movements of the friend.
  - The user can add or remove the friends profile from favorites.
  - The user can unfollow the profile of the friend.
  - The user can exit the page and reenter the homepage.
- The other two buttons on the homepage guide the user back to the emergency page or the users own profile page.
  - On the profile page the user can enter their name and update their status, as well as click on a button to share or hide their location from friends. They can also make a contact request to the app or delete their own profile.
## Have fun!
